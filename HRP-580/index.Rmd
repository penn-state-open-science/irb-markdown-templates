    practical, prepare a time line chart or schematic to accompany
    description of procedures and test for research that requires more
    than 1 or 2 steps/visits.

-   Identify all drugs or biologics (dose, frequency, and route of
    administration), devices, and procedures that are experimental or
    that are used in an experimental manner.

-   Indicate which are standard procedures (standard of care) versus
    research procedures. Identify any procedures which are experimental.
    Identify what procedures are part of regular medical care that will
    be done even if the subject does not take part in the research.

-   Indicate whether the research will include any hospitalizations or
    outpatient clinic visits or telephone or written follow-up.

-   Include the length and duration of visits and procedures.

-   If the research involves blood collection, indicate the amount \[in
    English units, teaspoons/tablespoons\] and how often and if any
    special preparation is required (e.g., fasting). Common blood and
    urine tests should be described as "common blood tests to determine
    your health status." List any tests that are out of the ordinary for
    the specific condition being studied in the research.

-   Indicate with whom the subject will interact, where the research
    will be done and when the research will be done.

-   If applicable, describe in lay terms randomization procedures,
    probability for random assignment to each treatment, double-blinds,
    emergency unblinding, and use of placebo. Include the following for
    a clinical trial that involves randomization. "You will be randomly
    assigned to receive one of the \[number\] study treatments. This
    means whichever study treatment you receive will be determined
    purely by chance. You will have a \[give the odds of being in any
    study group, e.g., equal chance, 1 out of 3, etc.\]. \[For
    double-blind studies\] Neither you nor the research team will know
    which study treatment you are receiving, but the research team will
    be able to get this information quickly if it is needed to ensure
    your safety. \[For single blind research studies\] You will not be
    told which treatment you are getting, however your study doctor will
    know."

    that the subject is free to skip any questions that he/she would
    prefer not to answer, unless that is not true.

-   If the study involves the use of educational records covered under
    FERPA, please indicate specifically which records the researcher
    requests to use of research purposes.

-   If the research involves a screening visit and includes tests or
    procedures that would not be done for clinical purposes, then
    consent must be obtained prior to the screening visit. Avoid wording
    such as "After the screening visit, if you are eligible to
    **participate** in the study, you will ..." Rather, use wording such
    as "After the screening visit, if you are eligible to **continue**
    in the research, you will ..." or "...if you are eligible to
    **receive** the research treatment, you will ..."

-   Include what will happen to any research specimens once the research
    is completed.

Your research data will only be available to researchers who have received approval from data access committees and/or Institutional Review Boards. Some of these databases are maintained by Penn State, some are maintained by the federal government, and some are maintained by private companies and other institutions.

[When applicable, include whether clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions; and for research involving biospecimens. The following is suggested text if it is not known if the research will have clinically relevant research results.]{.purple_italics}

Most tests done on samples in research studies are only for research
and have no clear meaning for health care. If the research with your
identifiable information or samples gives results that do have meaning
for your health, the researchers \<\<will/will not\>\> contact you to
let you know what they have found. *{For studies involving genetic
testing, add the following if applicable.}* If the researchers return
genetic test results to you, it is because they think you could have a
health risk and want to recommend that the test be re-done by a
certified clinical laboratory to check the results.  If this happens,
then it will be recommended that you get a second test from a
certified clinical laboratory, consult your own doctor, and/or
get genetic counseling. You may have to pay for those additional
services yourself.
