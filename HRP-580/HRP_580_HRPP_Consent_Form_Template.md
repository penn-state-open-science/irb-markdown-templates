consent and permission will be sought from their legally authorized
representatives.

Some of the people who are eligible to take part in this research study
may not be able to give consent to take part because of their medical
condition. Instead we will ask the person's legally authorized
representative to give consent. Throughout the consent form, "you"
always refers to the person who takes part in the research study.

enrolling children (less than 18 years of age) and permission will be
sought from their parent(s)/guardian(s).

Some of the people who are eligible to take part in this research study
may not be able to give consent because they are less than 18 years of
age (a minor). Instead we will ask their parent(s)/guardian(s) to give
permission for their participation in the study, and we may ask them to
agree (give assent) to take part. Throughout the consent form, when we
say "you", we mean you or your child.

> \- screening procedures that occur after signing the consent form
>
> \- treatment assignment/randomization
>
> \- procedures during treatment
>
> \- final visit and follow-up

    practical, prepare a time line chart or schematic to accompany
    description of procedures and test for research that requires more
    than 1 or 2 steps/visits.

-   Identify all drugs or biologics (dose, frequency, and route of
    administration), devices, and procedures that are experimental or
    that are used in an experimental manner.

-   Indicate which are standard procedures (standard of care) versus
    research procedures. Identify any procedures which are experimental.
    Identify what procedures are part of regular medical care that will
    be done even if the subject does not take part in the research.

-   Indicate whether the research will include any hospitalizations or
    outpatient clinic visits or telephone or written follow-up.

-   Include the length and duration of visits and procedures.

-   If the research involves blood collection, indicate the amount \[in
    English units, teaspoons/tablespoons\] and how often and if any
    special preparation is required (e.g., fasting). Common blood and
    urine tests should be described as "common blood tests to determine

    the specific condition being studied in the research.

-   Indicate with whom the subject will interact, where the research
    will be done and when the research will be done.

-   If applicable, describe in lay terms randomization procedures,
    probability for random assignment to each treatment, double-blinds,
    emergency unblinding, and use of placebo. Include the following for
    a clinical trial that involves randomization. "You will be randomly
    assigned to receive one of the \[number\] study treatments. This
    means whichever study treatment you receive will be determined
    purely by chance. You will have a \[give the odds of being in any
    study group, e.g., equal chance, 1 out of 3, etc.\]. \[For
    double-blind studies\] Neither you nor the research team will know
    which study treatment you are receiving, but the research team will

    that the subject is free to skip any questions that he/she would
    prefer not to answer, unless that is not true.

-   If the study involves the use of educational records covered under
    FERPA, please indicate specifically which records the researcher
    requests to use of research purposes.

-   If the research involves a screening visit and includes tests or
    procedures that would not be done for clinical purposes, then
    consent must be obtained prior to the screening visit. Avoid wording
    such as "After the screening visit, if you are eligible to
    **participate** in the study, you will ..." Rather, use wording such
    as "After the screening visit, if you are eligible to **continue**
    in the research, you will ..." or "...if you are eligible to
    **receive** the research treatment, you will ..."

-   Include what will happen to any research specimens once the research
    is completed.

-   When applicable indicate that the subject may be contacted for
